# ECE419 Distributed Systems Project
Implementation of key-value pair storage servers using concepts and techniques from distributed systems course.

Milestone 1: Simple single-server storage with client communications. Cache for quicker lookup on storage server.
Milestone 2: Multiple servers using hash ring to for scalable, distributed data storage. Used Zookeeper to monitor server status and handle server failures. 
Milestone 3: Implementation of replication, allowing for clients to request from multiple servers to retrieve information and prevent loss of data upon server failure.
Milestone 4: Notification system to identify changes to watched key-value pairs.
